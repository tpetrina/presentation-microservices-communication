## Agenda

<Layout style={{alignSelf: 'start'}}>

- What changed with microservices?
- How do we switch from requests to events?
- Where is our data?
- Recap

</Layout>

---

## What this talk is not about?

- Introduction to microservices
- Arguing for or against microservices

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="A procedural mindset"
function (model: CreateUserModel) {
    // first we create a new user in our main DB
    user = db.insertUser(model);

    // user has accepted to join organization
    db.addToOrganization(user, model.organizationId);

    // then we connect it to our external CRM used for tracking
    crm.connectUser(user.id, model);

    // don't forget to send welcome or confirmation email
    mail.sendConfirmEmail(user.email);

    // set-up for compaign
    campaign.setNewUser(user.id, new Date());
}
```

## Simple approach, complex outcomes

- Transactions on system boundary
  - Everything happens at once
  - Coupling => system is consistent
- Rouge component can bring down the system
- All components share same availability
- Procedure can be as complex as possible, all data is available

</Layout>

---

## SQL schema...and probably code

<LocalImage src="sql.png" />

---

## Some definitions

<Layout style={{fontSize: '0.6em'}}>

Microservices [...] are

- Highly maintainable and testable
- <span style={{ color: "#e32636" }}>Loosely coupled</span>
- Independently deployable
- <span style={{ color: "#e32636" }}>
    Organized around business capabilities
  </span>
- Owned by a small team

(from [microservices.io](https://microservices.io))

</Layout>

---

## Two problems

1. How do we _perform_ actions when components are distributed?
2. How do we _get_ data out of distributed systems?

---

## Within service

<LocalImage src="images/monolith.png" width="800px" />

---

## Request architecture

<LocalImage src="images/request-driven.png" width="800px" />

---

## Issues

<LocalImage src="images/request-driven-error.png" width="800px" />

---

## Events as a solution

<LocalImage src="images/event-driven.png" width="800px" />

---

<blockquote>Always emit events with Outbox pattern</blockquote>

---

<Layout>

## 1. Eventual consistency

Issues:

- "User created, but can't login"
- Data changed, but UI doesn't reflect it

Solve with:

- Sync write to read model in the same transaction
- Better UX (OK vs Accepted HTTP Status Code)
- Learn to live with it

</Layout>

---

<Layout>

## 2. Thundering herd and backpressure

- Subscribers must handle the load from producer
  - Could you handle Twitter load on your service in real time?
- [Thundering herds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem)

Solve with:

- Backpressure and limiting on queue ingestion

</Layout>

---

<Layout>

## 3. Observability

<LocalImage src="images/events-must-flow.jpg" width="800px" />

</Layout>

---

<LocalImage src="images/control-system.png" width="800px" />

---

<Layout>

## 4. Temporal decoupling

- Fast or slow workflows
- You might build a copy of a workflow engine
- Good reason to start using sagas

</Layout>

---

<Layout>

## 5. Distant failures

- How to notify user when event handling fails?
- Can we resolve them _through support_?
- All UX issues are business issues
- At-least-once and idempotency

</Layout>

---

## Message queue in front of each service

<LocalImage src="images/event-driven-queue.png" width="800px" />

---

<Layout>

## Queues are not the answer

- Processing speed
- Parallelization
- Retries and error handling

Think about:

- Message streams (e.g. Kafka)
- Poll model for recovery

</Layout>

---

## Data requirements

- Event was received, but does it contain enough data?
- Are API calls needed to fetch remaining data?

<CodeSurfer>

```json
{
  "user_id": "baadf00d"
}
```

```json
{
  "user_id": "baadf00d",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "organization_id": "1"
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<Layout>

## Why "fat" events?

- Less processing time
- Less pressure on original service

Keep in mind:

- GDPR, security issues

</Layout>

---

## Sagas

<LocalImage src="images/Create_Order_Saga.png" width="1400px" />

(from [microservices.io](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html))

---

<Layout>

## Events

- Events _are_ your API, design accordingly
- Centralized documentation and repository
- Versioning
- Granularity: CRUD or hyper detailed
  - `UserCreated`, `UserBanned`, `UserUnbanned`, `UserBlocked`
  - `UserCreated`, `UserModified`, `UserDeleted`

</Layout>

---

## Options

1. Sync communication
2. Events (fire and forget)
   - Message streams
3. Events choreograpy
4. Centralized process manager
5. BFFs

---

## Anti-patterns

- Chatty events or chain events
  - Essential workflows are implicit and hard to debug
- Coupling services with complex choreograpy
  - Details might be lost, easy to break others, hard to roll out fixes
- Sagas for everything
  - Logic leaks out into API Gateway or other unknown services
- Domain leaking
  - Prefer losing context when receiving events

# Data access

---

## What about queries?

- Querying data inside service is simple
- Filtering, sorting, pagination across services is harder
- We really like joining data
  - Are those even relational databases?

---

## Types of reads

- Querying data from external endpoint
  - For UI, reports, public API
- Checking data as a part of the process
  - Validation, verification
- Composing data as a part of the process
  - Putting enough information into archive for easy lookup
  - E.g. address at the point of purchase

---

<Layout>

## Can I use events for reading?

- They need to cover all state changes
- They need to be obtained on demand
- We shouldn't duplicate domain logic

Solve instead with:

- Data replication e.g. Debezium
- Data sync microservice

</Layout>

---

## Who owns data?

- Static data/metadata
  - VAT rules, countries, timezones, domain specific constant data
- Master data
  - Data commonly used across microservices
- Lookup data
  - From one service to another

---

## Static data/metadata

1. Ship with the app as a package (Nuget, npm, gem)
2. Data management microservice (cron update)

---

## Master data (reference data)

- Often changing data that is used in various services
- Need to have a canonical data owner
- Create caches next to the services that need them
  - Sync via events
  - Sync via cron job
  - Anti-corruption layer to assure interesting data stays there

---

## What about JOINs?

- Yeah, what about them?
- Do it:
  1. in-app
  2. in API Gateway
  3. in a dedicated data lake/custom db

<blockquote>
  Fetch customers 21-40 which have outstanding orders sorted by last order sent.
</blockquote>

---

## Could vs Should

- You **could** `JOIN` in DB
- Is this **critical** business functionality?

---

## Accidental complexity

- Splitting systems does not remove the need for their interaction
- Required interactions become more complex
- Optional interactions complicate UX

---

## Service boundaries

---

## Recap

- Modeling distributed system is hard
- Use pain points to guide implementation and design
- Design and document events

---

<Layout>

## What's next?

- Testing...
